This application is a sample implementation of two algorithms in PHP: depth-first
and breadth-first.

Each of these searches a tree for a node that doesn't actually exist in the tree;
this signifies the exit point of the maze. At that point, they retrace their
path and return a string of the steps necessary to reach the end.

By default the configuration is such that the maze is generated autmatically.
However, the maze could be provided by the user to test.
